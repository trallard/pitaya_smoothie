Welcome to this project and thanks for thinking about contributing to it 🙏🏼.

To get started, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and sign-in. 

You'll use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with formatting. For example, you could write words as bold (**bold**), or in italics (*italics*), or as a link ([link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)) to another webpage.

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)

## Share your thoughts, bugs, requests and the such

Issues are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forward. A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.

Issues are assigned [labels][labels] which explain how they relate to the overall project's goals and immediate next steps.

### Issue labels

The current list of labels are [here][labels] and include:

* ![Question](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question%20❔-d876e3.svg) These issues are questions and represent a great place to start. Whoever has opened the issue wants to hear from you!

 To reply, read the question and then respond in a variety of different ways:
 
 * If you want to agree with everything you can react to the post with one of :+1: :rocket: :heart: :tada:
 * Alternatively you could write a comment to:
   * express your emotions more dramatically 
   * provide a more nuanced description of your answer (using your words)
   * ask for a clarification
   * ask a follow-up question

<br>

* ![No Code ⚡️](https://img.shields.io/badge/-no%20code%20⚡️-602080.svg) These issues don't require any coding knowledge.
 
 If you're looking to contribute but aren't very confident in your coding skills, these issues are a great place to start.
 
 All issues with the `no code :lightning:` label are asking for feedback or suggestions.

<br>

* ![Good First Issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-7057ff.svg) These issues contain a task that anyone with any level of experience can help.
 
 We can not encourage you enough to submit even the tiniest change to the project repository. Let's go from :confused: & :anguished: to :smiley: & :tada: together!

<br>

* ![Help Wanted 🙌🏼](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted%20🙌-01d28e.svg) These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.

 If you have particular skills, then consider reading through these issues as they are a great place to offer your expertise.
 
 If you aren't sure what to offer, you could also recommend issues to your friends/colleagues who may be able to help.
 
<br>

* ![Bugs 🐛](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug%20🐛-eb4d4b.svg) These issues point to problems in the project.

 If you find a bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue.
 
 If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment.

<br>

* ![Enhancement ✨](https://img.shields.io/badge/-enhancement%20✨-9B90C8.svg) These issues are asking for enhancements to be added to the project.

Please try to make sure that your enhancement is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's similar, but there are subtle differences, please reference the other request in your issue.

<br>


* ![Documentation 📖](https://img.shields.io/badge/-documentation%20📖-ffb5b5.svg) These issues are asking for enhancements or improvement to the documentation.

## Make a change

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :tada::smiley:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment on the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

   [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is an excellent explanation of why putting this work in upfront is so useful to everyone involved.

2. [Fork][link_fork] the [Pitaya Smoothie repo][link_repo] to your profile.

   You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work, so you're super safe.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

   Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much more manageable!

4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].
   The maintainer will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :tada: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:

## Thank you!

You are awesome. :purple_heart::sparkles::star:

And if you've found typos in this (or any other) page, you could consider submitting your very first pull request to fix them.
